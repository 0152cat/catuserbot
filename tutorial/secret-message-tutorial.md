# SECRET MESSAGE TUTORIAL

â˜žAdded to send secret message from your bot\(present only 64 characters supported\)

Syntax : \(Your bot username\) secret \(person username/id\) message

bot username means the bot which created in @botfather and added in heroku vars at the time of deployment secret must be in that \(it acts like command here\)

â˜žwhile making this i dont know that call-backquery supports only 64 characters after made found it is [error](https://t.me/c/1220993104/680075) so need to redesign it

â˜žif you dont get above point dont make mess in group it just says that you cant send long messages in secret message now i will rewrite code to send lengthy messages

â˜žExample : [check this image](https://t.me/catuserbot_support/177427) and click on that secret message âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–
